-->What is Big Data?
    The different types of data being generated from various sources, categorized into three main types:

Structured Data:

Data that is organized in a defined format such as tables.
Examples: Rows and columns in a database (e.g., Excel sheets, SQL databases).
Semi-Structured Data:

Data that does not conform to a strict structure like tables but still has some organizational properties for easier parsing.
Examples: JSON, XML, CSV, TSV files, and Emails.
Unstructured Data:

Data that has no predefined structure and is difficult to organize or analyze without special tools.
Examples: Log files, audio, video, images, and other multimedia files.
 
Everyone is creating almost 40 Exabytes data per month.
