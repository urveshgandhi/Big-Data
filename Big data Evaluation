---> Big data Evaluation 
    ● 1960 - txt files
    ● 1970 - spreadsheets/DBMS
    ● 1980 - RDBMS but Licenced
    ● 1990 - Data warehouse (many RDBMS) - Damm costly
    ● 1995 - DFS found by Doug Cutting but failed due to processing wasn’t good
    ● 2003 - Google released GFS paper  same as DFS == GFS
    ● 2004 - Google Released Mapreduce paper → Distributed Processing → Doug Cutting read the paper and was Shocked
    ● 2005 - DFS enhanced and use  Mapreduce
    ● 2006 - DFS + Mapreduce =  Hadoop (name on son's elephant Doll) , HDFS and Mapreduce
    ● 2008 - Emerged a lot  -- Problem -- Hey Mapreduce code is damn hard to understand JAVA —>  Doug Cutting said --> do not worry I have a solution to simplify MapReduce —>  Learn SQL —>  Trigger SQL —> I will ensure my TOOL converts SQL query to Mapreduce JAVA
    ● I found a tool, it looks like SQL but not --- If you trigger any queries -- it converts into a Mapreduce JAVA
    ● In 2008 - Hive and Pig came into the market
      ○ Mark Zuckerberg --- Facebook using --- HIVE
      ○ Yahoo--using -- PIG  (Not Popular)
    ● 2009 -CLOUDERA - Problem was  --for  installation and Maintenance -need Laptop
      ○ Give me Laptop But Installation, maintenance, and Upgrade - are Paid services
    ● 2011  - HortonWorks - Give me laptop and Installation —> Free, Maintenance and Upgrade are Paid
    ● 2014 -SPARK-  Birth of a super Power
      ○ Superpower, Process data very faster, Free of cost, Will perform SQL, Will support Streaming, Will support Machine learning, Can run ON Hadoop
    ● 2016 -Cloud- I will give u laptops, I will install, upgrade, and Maintenance
      ○ AWS EMR - Single Click of Button Hadoop Laptops will be ready within 10 Min by AWS
      ○ Azure HDInsights
      ○ Google cloud platform - GCP
      ○ Alibaba cloud
    ● 2017 - Cloudera Bought Horton works
    ● 2022 -- We live in the Cloud Big Data market = Cloud-based Hadoop Big Data analytics
   
    Cloud Hadoop Spark   ===> Crazy Technology today

----->  What is DFS?
          Introduced by Doug Cutting in 1995.
           ● License-free
           ● We don’t need RDBMS servers
           ● How DFS works - for example, there are 4 laptops - 1 is Gateway and the other 3 are interconnected to each like the below image 
               ○ Gateway  - Once you give data, data gets stored on the Gateway node first then after running a few commands it is distributed in other 3 nodes
               ○ Put data into Gateway node
               ○ Gateway will divide data into Nodes
